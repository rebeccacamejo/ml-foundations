# 04 ‑ Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning uncovers hidden structure in data without labelled outcomes.  In this section I explored two dimensionality‑reduction and clustering techniques: **K‑Means** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for synthetic data, and **t‑Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t‑SNE)** for visualising complex high‑dimensional patterns in handwritten digits.

These methods are widely used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection and exploratory data analysis.  By grouping similar observations or reducing dimensionality, businesses can gain new insights into their products, customers or operational processes.

## Industry applications

- **FinTech:** Use k‑means to **segment customers** by spend patterns, product mix, or risk; or apply anomaly detection to flag suspicious transactions outside typical clusters.  
- **SaaS:** Apply PCA and clustering to **group users** by feature usage and engagement level; use these clusters to tailor onboarding and pricing tiers.  
- **Logistics:** Cluster **delivery routes** or **shipments** based on geography, weight, and frequency to optimize drop sequencing and fleet allocation.  
- **Construction/field services:** Cluster **service jobs** by equipment type, time to complete, and profit margin, helping dispatchers plan routes and allocate specialists.

## Future case study ideas

- **FinTech:** Cluster **merchant transactions** into groups (e.g., high risk, low risk, high volume) and use cluster membership to calibrate fraud thresholds.  
- **SaaS:** Identify clusters of customers with similar **feature adoption trajectories** to preempt churn or propose premium upgrades; validate through A/B tests.  
- **Logistics:** Use unsupervised learning to uncover **hidden patterns** in carrier performance (e.g., cluster by on‑time rate, claims frequency) to renegotiate contracts.  
- **Construction/field services:** Cluster **repeat service calls** to detect latent issues in certain models/brands of equipment, then recommend targeted replacement or warranty policies.
